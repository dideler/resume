  \begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
    \item Designed and built a robust and scalable order data pipeline,
          creating an immutable audit trail of reliable operational and financial data.
          The data stream introduced a decoupled data schema, laying the ground work
          for a future eCommerce system, and enabled a diverse range of consumers
          for any team to build product applications, perform analysis, and execute critical reporting.
          % The eCommerce system and the database would overwrite data resulting in data loss and
          % structure it in a way that makes it difficult to analyse.
          % The data stream was modular and decoupled.
          % The order pipeline was fed by events from the eCommerce system which were published
          % whenever an event occurred that wrote order-related data.
          % The events would ultimately feed into a data warehouse.
          % The pipeline was incredibly robust, handled large events (which
          % didn't fit through the pipes by default), deduplication, sorting, introduced
          % a new order data schema by translating events in the stream that use the legacy schema,
          % had its own monitoring and alerting, could handle spikes and outages,
          % had various recovery procedures, had the option for consumers to replay events,
          % and custom tooling to help inspect and debug events and the pipeline.
          % It allowed for fan-out messaging, meaning anyone could subscribe and consume the data.
          % With the creation of an order data pipeline, any team could now consume those published events.
          % This enabled a new team to build a new major product, a customer loyalty program.
          % I assisted them by introducing them to the order events, reviewing their requirements,
          % building the consumer on their serverless service, and assisting the tech lead with processing the order data further downstream.
    \item Researched and built innovative prototypes, such as an event sourcing solution for the order
          data stream and time travel of historical order data to aid recovery and analsysis.
          % which would take changes in data, represented as lightweight events, to build flexible data projections
          % to answer questions. Events could be replayed, providing extra flexibility for testing,
          % analsysis, and recovery. Data integrity is ensured by only appending data to create an
          % immutable audit trail.
    \item Significantly reduced financial and tax gaps which affected the accounting month end's
          process and the company's revenue. Collaborated with the customer support and accounting
          teams to fix issues in the data collection and standard operating procedures. Effectively
          reducing the number of support tickets and improving the customer experience.
          % Not collecting tax on orders. Collecting incorrect tax on orders. Wrong tax dates on orders. Etc.
          % Overwriting order data. Reporting operations incorrectly.
          % Deprecated eCommerce admin flows, redesigned admin flows (combine steps), new admin flows.
          % Fixed a longstanding bug that affected order cancelations. Cancelation jobs would not retry.
          % This would lead to dozens of tickets a day for the Customer Support team.
    \item Increased org-wide engineering efficiency by improving monitoring of systems
          and implementing a new deployment process for the monolith app's staging environment,
          resulting in a non-blocking process for teams and individuals.
          % Monitoring around admin SOPs, order cancelations, deployments
          % (who, what, why, when, where, and how)
          % Phased releases w/ feature flags, etc.
          % Not exclusive to this role, have done this since FC.
