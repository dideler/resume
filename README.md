You can produce the PDF with the command `pdflatex`.  

You'll want to automate this when making lots of changes.  
- Install Ruby
- Install Bundler: `gem install bundler`
- Install Ruby dependencies: `bundle install`
- Run Guard to compile the source whenever it detects changes: `bundle exec guard`

Or try a LaTeX IDE like [Texmaker] or [Overleaf] \(previously writeLaTeX).
