I only update my résumé when I have to send it out, so if you're lurking, you're
better off reading [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisideler).

I use `pdflatex` to produce the PDF.

Interesting stuff:
- [Convert to ASCII](http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=fmtconv+toascii)
- [Tutorial for a CV in LaTeX](http://texblog.org/2012/04/25/writing-a-cv-in-latex/)
  -- I didn't use this, but could be useful to others
- [CV template on WriteLatex](https://www.writelatex.com/examples) -- I might
  switch to this, it's really nice
