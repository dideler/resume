If my résumé isn't up to date, try [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisideler).

Run `make` or `make help` to see what's possible.

For example `make install build_resume`

Or try a LaTeX plugin for your IDE, or a dedicated LaTeX IDE like [Texmaker] or [Overleaf] \(previously writeLaTeX).
