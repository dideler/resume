I only update my resume when I have to send it out, so if you're lurking, you're
better off reading my LinkedIn profile: http://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisideler.

I use `pdflatex` to produce the PDF.

Interesting stuff:
- [Convert to ASCII](http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=fmtconv+toascii)
- [CV in LaTeX tutorial](http://texblog.org/2012/04/25/writing-a-cv-in-latex/)
  -- I didn't use this, but it could be handy for others.
