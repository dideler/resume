I only update my résumé when I have to send it out, so if you're lurking, you're
better off reading [my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisideler).

I quickly get bored of my résumés and completely redo them.
You can view my previous résumé in the `old-resume` branch.

I use `pdflatex` to produce the PDF.
